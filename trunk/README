ABOUT
=====
Pardus for Android is a convenient web client for the massive multiplayer
online game Pardus. Besides the standard browser component its features are:

- Local images:
An image pack is downloaded at the application's first start. Subsequently images
are loaded only from the local image pack, saving expensive mobile network traffic
and improving performance.

- Extensibility:
The support of Greasemonkey-compatible user scripts lets you customize Pardus
in every way.

- Secure access:
By default all data from and to the Pardus servers is securely sent through HTTPS.
Links unrelated to Pardus are opened in a new browser application without access
to sensitive data. Optionally you can set the app to log your account out of Pardus
whenever it loses focus.

- Fast access:
If you choose to save your account credentials, you are automatically logged in
at the app's startup. A floating menu bar instead of two frames saves space, and
the customizable links let you browse through pages more quickly.

- Free and open-source:
Pardus for Android is free and may be improved/extended/forked by anybody as long
as it keeps its current open-source license. The program's and any ensuing work's
open source also enables you to verify it is not malicious - but behaving exactly
as advertised.
